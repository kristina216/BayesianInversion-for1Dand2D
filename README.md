# BayesianInversion-for1Dand2D
The files in this repository are a result of my master thesis "Uncertainty quantification using Bayesian inversion applied to the DC resistivity problem".

It includes scripts for Bayesian inversion in 1D and 2D for geopyhsical studies. In particular for DC resistivity problems.
It uses the Metropol-Hastings algorithm and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm.
